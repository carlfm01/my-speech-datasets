I'm training a Mozilla's DeepSpeech model using public domain data, I'll be releasing the data I collect also under public domain.

## About Data collection methodology

Automatically aligned the text with the Windows speech recognition, then as validation of the alignment used a Mozilla's DeepSpeech model using a few different language models. The first model to start the validation was trained on voxforge Spanish data and on top of the ones that score the highest confidence with the Windows Speech.

## Languages
Initially I'm collecting only Spanish, eventually I'll add more languages.
